## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Peer dependencies requirements:
>
> - **`@rsbuild/core >= 1.0.0-alpha.9`**: Rsbuild is about to release version 1.0.0, and the current alpha version is already very reliable. (checkout Rsbuild's [1.0.0 breaking changes](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rsbuild/discussions/2508))
> - **`storybook >= 8.2.1`**: Storybook made some internal refactor in major version, 8.2.1 is tested out. (checkout Storybook's [release note](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8/) for migrating from v7)

In Storybook v8, you don't need to manually install storybook-builder-rsbuild, it has been depended by the framework, such as `storybook-react-rsbuild` and `storybook-vue3-rsbuild`.

### Use with React

1. Install React framework integration
   ```bash
   pnpm i storybook-react-rsbuild -D
   ```
2. Change `.storybook/main.js`

   ```js
   import { StorybookConfig } from 'storybook-react-rsbuild'

   const config: StorybookConfig = {
     framework: 'storybook-react-rsbuild',
     rsbuildFinal: (config) => {
       // Customize the final Rsbuild config here
       return config;
     },
   };

   export default config;
   ```

You're all set now. You could also checkout the example in [sandboxes/react-rsbuild](./sandboxes/react-rsbuild).

### Use with Vue 3

1. Install Vue3 framework integration
   ```bash
   pnpm i storybook-vue3-rsbuild -D
   ```
2. Change `.storybook/main.js`

   ```js
   import { StorybookConfig } from 'storybook-vue3-rsbuild'

   const config: StorybookConfig = {
     framework: 'storybook-vue3-rsbuild',
     rsbuildFinal: (config) => {
       // Customize the final Rsbuild config here
       return config;
     },
   };

   export default config;
   ```

You're all set now. You could also checkout the example in [sandboxes/vue3-rsbuild](./sandboxes/vue3-rsbuild).

### Customize the Rsbuild config

The builder _will_ read your `rsbuild.config.js` file, though it may change some of the options in order to work correctly.
It looks for the Rsbuild config in the CWD. If your config is located elsewhere, specify the path using the `rsbuildConfigPath` builder option:

```javascript
// .storybook/main.mjs

const config = {
  framework: {
    name: 'storybook-react-rsbuild',
    options: {
      builder: {
        rsbuildConfigPath: '.storybook/customRsbuildConfig.js',
      },
    },
  },
}

export default config
```

You can also override the merged Rsbuild config:

```javascript
// use `mergeRsbuildConfig` to recursively merge Rsbuild options
import { mergeRsbuildConfig } from '@rsbuild/core'

const config = {
  async rsbuildFinal(config, { configType }) {
    // Be sure to return the customized config
    return mergeRsbuildConfig(config, {
      // Customize the Rsbuild config for Storybook
      source: {
        alias: { foo: 'bar' },
      },
    })
  },
}

export default config
```

The `rsbuildFinal` function will give you `config` which is the combination of your project's Rsbuild config and the builder's own Rsbuild config.
You can tweak this as you want, for example to set up aliases, add new plugins etc.

The `configType` variable will be either `"DEVELOPMENT"` or `"PRODUCTION"`.

The function should return the updated Rsbuild configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Error caused by bundling unexpected files

> [!NOTE]
> Rspack starts to support `webpackInclude` magic comment, this trouble won't exists since 0.0.7

Because Rspack temporarily does not support the `webpackInclude` magic comment, non-story files may be bundled, which could lead to build failures. These files can be ignored using `rspack.IgnorePlugin` (see exmaple https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild/issues/19).

```js
// .storybook/main.js
import path from 'path'
import { mergeRsbuildConfig } from '@rsbuild/core'

export default {
  framework: 'storybook-react-rsbuild',
  async rsbuildFinal(config) {
    return mergeRsbuildConfig(config, {
      tools: {
        rspack: (config, { addRules, appendPlugins, rspack, mergeConfig }) => {
          return mergeConfig(config, {
            plugins: [
              new rspack.IgnorePlugin({
                checkResource: (resource, context) => {
                  // for example, ignore all markdown files
                  const absPathHasExt = path.extname(resource)
                  if (absPathHasExt === '.md') {
                    return true
                  }

                  return false
                },
              }),
            ],
          })
        },
      },
    })
  },
}
```
