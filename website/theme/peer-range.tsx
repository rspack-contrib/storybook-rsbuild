/**
 * Renders a peer dependency range exactly as declared in the package manifests
 * under `packages/`. The ranges are read at config time in `rstack.config.ts`
 * and injected via Rsbuild `source.define`, so docs never drift from what is
 * published.
 *
 * Set `cell` when rendering inside a table cell: GFM splits cells on `|` even
 * inside code spans, so the `.md` / llms.txt build (Rspress sets `__SSR_MD__`
 * for its `node_md` environment) must escape the `||` of a union such as
 * `^1.5.0 || ^2.0.0-0`. Outside a table that backslash would be literal.
