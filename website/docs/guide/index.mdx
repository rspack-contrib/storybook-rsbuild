:::info Storybook versions

The `main` branch ships the Storybook v10 Rsbuild builder together with each framework integration. Use the table below to match your Storybook version, and review the [official migration guide](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#from-version-9x-to-1000) before moving to v10.

| Storybook | Storybook Rsbuild                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| v10       | [^3.0.0](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild)         |
| v9        | [^2.0.0](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild/tree/v2) |
| v8        | [^1.0.0](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild/tree/v1) |

:::

Storybook Rsbuild allows you to use [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.rs) as the build engine for Storybook, providing faster startup and build times.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using the Storybook CLI.

### New Project

If you are setting up a new project, we recommend creating an Rsbuild project first, then adding Storybook.

```bash
# 1. Create a new Rsbuild project
npm create rsbuild@latest

# 2. Initialize Storybook (in the project root)
npx storybook@latest init
```

Storybook will detect Rsbuild and automatically configure `storybook-builder-rsbuild` for you. It will also add example stories to your project. To understand the generated files, check the [Storybook Project Structure](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure/sidebar-and-urls).

### Existing Project

If you are migrating an existing Storybook project to Rsbuild, install the relevant framework package and update your `.storybook/main.ts`.

See the **[Frameworks](/guide/framework/react)** section for detailed migration guides.

## Usage

:::info Peer dependency requirements

- **`@rsbuild/core >= 1.0.1`** — Storybook Rsbuild depends on the stable Rsbuild 1.0 runtime. See the [1.0 release announcement](https://rsbuild.rs/community/releases/v1-0) for background.
- **`storybook >= 10.0.0`** — The packages are validated against Storybook 10. Upgrade guidance is available in the [Storybook release notes](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-10/).

:::

When using the v8-compatible packages, you do not install `storybook-builder-rsbuild` directly. Framework packages such as `storybook-react-rsbuild` and `storybook-vue3-rsbuild` include it for you.

Use the following framework guides to plug Storybook Rsbuild into your project.

## Use with frameworks

### React

See [integrating with React](/guide/framework/react).

### Vue

See [integrating with Vue](/guide/framework/vue).

### Vanilla JS/TS

See [integrating with vanilla JavaScript / TypeScript](/guide/framework/vanilla).

### Web components

See [integrating with web components (Lit)](/guide/framework/web-components).

## Integration

### With Modern.js

Use your existing Modern.js configuration inside Storybook.

See [integrating with Modern.js](/guide/integrations/modernjs).

### With Rslib

Reuse your existing Rslib configuration inside Storybook.

See [integrating with Rslib](/guide/integrations/rslib).

### With Rspack

Connect Storybook Rsbuild to an existing Rspack setup.

See [integrating with Rspack](/guide/integrations/rspack).
