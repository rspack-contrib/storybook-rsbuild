## Usage

:::info{title="Peer dependency requirements"}

- **`@rsbuild/core >= 1.0.1`** — Storybook Rsbuild depends on the stable Rsbuild 1.0 runtime. See the [1.0 release announcement](https://rsbuild.rs/community/releases/v1-0) for background.
- **`storybook >= 9.0.0`** — The packages are validated against Storybook 9. Upgrade guidance is available in the [Storybook release notes](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8/).

## Use with frameworks

### React

See [integrating with React](/guide/framework/react).

See [integrating with Vue](/guide/framework/vue).

### Vanilla JS/TS

See [integrating with vanilla JavaScript / TypeScript](/guide/framework/vanilla).

### Web components

See [integrating with web components (Lit)](/guide/framework/web-components).

## Integration

### With Rslib

Reuse your existing Rslib configuration inside Storybook.

See [integrating with Rslib](/guide/integrations/rslib).

### With Rspack
