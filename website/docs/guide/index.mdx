## Usage

:::info{title="Peer dependencies requirements"}

- **`@rsbuild/core >= 1.0.1`**: The builder relies on Rsbuild's 1.0 stable version. Check out Rsbuild's [1.0](https://rsbuild.dev/community/releases/v1-0) announcement for more details.
- **`storybook >= 8.2.1`**: Storybook made some internal refactor in major version, 8.2.1 is tested out. (check out Storybook's [release note](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8/) for migrating from v7)

:::

In Storybook v8, you don't need to manually install storybook-builder-rsbuild, it has been depended by the framework, such as `storybook-react-rsbuild` and `storybook-vue3-rsbuild`.
