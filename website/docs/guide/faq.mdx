## Deploy Storybook to a subdirectory / subpath

The default Vite and webpack builders in Storybook use relative paths for references, whereas Rsbuild does not recommend using relative paths for deployment (See the [tips](https://rsbuild.dev/config/output/asset-prefix#path-types:~:text=on%20file%20location.-,TIP,-It%27s%20not%20recommended)). Therefore, if you want to deploy Storybook on a sub-path such as `https://example.com/sb-path`, you can achieve this by configuring [`output.assetPrefix`](https://rsbuild.dev/config/output/asset-prefix).

```diff
const config: StorybookConfig = {
  // --snip--
  rsbuildFinal: (config) => {
+   config.output ??= {}
+   config.output.assetPrefix = '/sb-path/'
    return config
  },
  // --snip--
}
```

## Error caused by bundling unexpected files

> [!NOTE]
> Rspack starts to support `webpackInclude` magic comment, this trouble won't exists since 0.0.7

Because Rspack temporarily does not support the `webpackInclude` magic comment, non-story files may be bundled, which could lead to build failures. These files can be ignored using `rspack.IgnorePlugin` (see exmaple https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild/issues/19).

```js
// .storybook/main.js
import path from 'path'
import { mergeRsbuildConfig } from '@rsbuild/core'

export default {
  framework: 'storybook-react-rsbuild',
  async rsbuildFinal(config) {
    return mergeRsbuildConfig(config, {
      tools: {
        rspack: (config, { addRules, appendPlugins, rspack, mergeConfig }) => {
          return mergeConfig(config, {
            plugins: [
              new rspack.IgnorePlugin({
                checkResource: (resource, context) => {
                  // for example, ignore all markdown files
                  const absPathHasExt = path.extname(resource)
                  if (absPathHasExt === '.md') {
                    return true
                  }

                  return false
                },
              }),
            ],
          })
        },
      },
    })
  },
}
```

## Why using `getAbsolutePath` to resolve the framework in sandboxes in this repository?

Check out https://storybook.js.org/docs/faq#how-do-i-fix-module-resolution-in-special-environments.

## How to debug the Rsbuild and Rspack config of the Storybook builder?

Based on Rsbuild, you can directly use the [CLI debug capability](https://rsbuild.dev/guide/debug/debug-mode) provided by Rsbuild for debugging. For example:

In development mode:

```bash
DEBUG=rsbuild storybook dev
```

In production mode:

```bash
DEBUG=rsbuild storybook build
```

Check the output in the CLI, you can see where the Rsbuild and Rspack configuration is dumped on the disk and view it.
