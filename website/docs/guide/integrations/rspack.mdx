# Rspack

Rsbuild is a higher-level framework built on Rspack. Within Rsbuild, you can directly apply and modify Rspack's configurations. Therefore, storybook-builder-rsbuild is also capable of accepting and altering Rspack's configurations.

You could check the [example](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild/tree/main/sandboxes/rspack-react-18) of a React project with Storybook.

## Setup

To setup a Rspack project with Storybook, you need to install the following dependencies:

### 1. Install dependencies

As an example of a React project, in addition to installing `storybook-react-rsbuild` as per the [React framework guide](/guide/framework/react), you also need to install the relevant dependencies of Rsbuild for a Rspack project.

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @rsbuild/core @rsbuild/plugin-react -D" />

At this point, please ensure that at least the following dependencies are correctly installed:

- `storybook`
- `@rsbuild/core`
- `@rsbuild/plugin-react`
- `storybook-react-rsbuild`

### 2. Setup `rsbuild.config.ts`

Just like [@storybook/builder-webpack5](https://storybook.js.org/docs/builders/webpack#import-a-custom-webpack-configuration) provides out-of-the-box configurations and supports custom configurations, Storybook Rsbuild will read Rsbuild's config file. Therefore, we need to complete the basic configuration for a React project here.

```ts title=rsbuild.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core'
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginReact()],
})
```

### 3. Setup `.storybook/main.ts`

Same as the configuration in the [React framework guide](/guide/framework/react.html#setup-storybookmaints), setup the framework to `storybook-react-rsbuild`.

```ts title=.storybook/main.ts
import { StorybookConfig } from 'storybook-react-rsbuild'

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  framework: 'storybook-react-rsbuild',
}

export default config
```

At this point, you can start Storybook using `npx storybook dev`. However, note that the Storybook here uses the basic configuration of `@rsbuild/core` and `@rsbuild/plugin-react`. This means that if the current stories' source code depends on other Rspack build configurations, you can refer to step 4 to add custom Rspack configurations.

### 4. Apply custom webpack configurations (optional)

This step is optional, it's only necessary if you need to apply custom Rspack configurations to the Storybook Rsbuild build.

Now, let's clarify the roles of each config file:

- `rspack.config.ts`: The configuration file for Rspack, used to configure the entry, output, loader, plugin, etc., for the current app build.
- `rsbuild.config.ts`: The configuration file for Rsbuild, used to configure the entry, output, loader, plugin, etc., for the Storybook Rsbuild build.

If you want to use Rspack's configuration in the Storybook Rsbuild build, you can directly import `rspack.config.ts` in `rsbuild.config.ts` and merge its configuration items into Rsbuild's configuration through `tools.rspack`. For more ways to configure Rspack in Rsbuild, please refer to [tools.rspack](https://rsbuild.dev/config/tools/rspack).

In the following example, we import the `less-loader` configuration from `rspack.config.ts` and re-use it in the Storybook Rsbuild build configuration.

```ts title=rspack.config.ts {3,7-13}
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core'
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react'
import rspackConfig from './rspack.config.cjs'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginReact()],
  tools: {
    rspack: (config) => {
      const lessLoader = rspackConfig.module.rules[2]
      config.module!.rules!.push(lessLoader)
      return config
    },
  },
})
```
