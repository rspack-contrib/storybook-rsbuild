# React

Storybook for React & Rsbuild lets you develop and test React components in isolation using the Rsbuild toolchain your app already relies on.

## Requirements

<div style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '400px' }}>

| Package | Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| `react` | ≥ 16.8 |
| `@rsbuild/core` | ≥ 1.0.1 |
| `storybook` | ≥ 10.0.0 |

</div>

## Getting started

Follow these steps inside an existing Rsbuild-powered React project.

### Installation

Install the framework package to enable React support.

<PackageManagerTabs command="install storybook-react-rsbuild -D" />

### Configure `.storybook/main.ts`

```js
import { StorybookConfig } from 'storybook-react-rsbuild'

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  framework: 'storybook-react-rsbuild',
  rsbuildFinal: (config) => {
    // Customize the final Rsbuild config here
    return config
  },
}

export default config
```

That's it! Explore the [React 16](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild/blob/main/sandboxes/react-16) and [React 18](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/storybook-rsbuild/blob/main/sandboxes/react-18) sandboxes for full examples, and continue learning from the [Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs).

## Next Steps

Now that you've set up the build system, learn how to write stories and document your components:

- **[Writing Stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories)**: Learn the basics of Component Story Format (CSF).
- **[Auto-docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-docs/autodocs)**: Automatically generate documentation from your components.

## Options

Please refer to the [Configuration Guide](/guide/configuration#framework-options) for framework-specific options and defaults.
